  Your homepage should provide a sense of your company’s values, unique selling proposition (USP), and purpose.
Your logo, tagline, and purpose need to take center stage. In fact, you might even want to add a form or statement to the very top of your homepage — preferably in a large font — that gives your visitors a sense of what you do:

What problems do you solve for your customers? How do you improve your clients’ lives — whether personal or professional?

Css grid Notes:
grid:
grid-template-{columns,rows} defines size of container pieces
repeat(n, v) repeats value n times
grid-template combines both

items:
grid-column-start/end: span
start !< end
values can be negative to refer to end
span refers to how many from start or end
use / to split between start and end with grid-column
grid-row also exists
grid-area combines column-{start,end} row-{start,end} separated by /
order: changes order
